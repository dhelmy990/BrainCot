In this groundbreaking study, researchers Ruchit Agrawal and Simon Dixon delve into a hybrid method for music alignment that integrates neural networks with the classic Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) technique. Dynamic Time Warping has traditionally been the go-to for synchronizing musical scores with performances, but it relies heavily on handcrafted features, which can be limiting.

This study introduces a modern twist: utilizing neural networks as a preprocessing step to enhance the DTW method. Specifically, a "Siamese" Convolutional Neural Network is employed to construct a frame similarity matrix from raw audio data, enabling the DTW algorithm to find the optimal alignment path. This innovative step helps circumvent the need for manual feature engineering and allows the system to adapt to different acoustic environmentsâ€”a significant improvement over traditional methods.

Experiments were performed using the MAPS database, which contains a variety of acoustic piano recordings. By transforming audio into image spectrograms, the team tested alignment accuracy using both Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Constant-Q Transform (CQT). The results were impressive, showing alignment accuracy of over 81% in non-standard acoustic conditions when utilizing a distance-based similarity matrix.

The research highlights the promising potential of this adaptable approach to music alignment. While traditional DTW-based methods struggle with diverse acoustic settings, this hybrid model appears robust across different conditions without needing extensive labeled data for training. Future directions include refining the alignment process and exploring end-to-end learning for even better accuracy and efficiency. This study marks a significant step forward in Music Information Retrieval, opening up new possibilities for musical synchronization and analysis in varied environments.
